**Project Title:** Remote Worker Productivity Analysis
**Completion Date:** August 2025

**Overview**
This project explores the key factors that influence productivity among remote workers using a simulated dataset of 1,000 participants. The dataset includes features across demographics, work habits, work environment, and wellbeing. The goal is to identify drivers of productivity through data exploration, modeling, and clustering.

**Objectives**

- Understand what behavioral and environmental factors correlate with higher productivity.
- Build predictive models to quantify feature importance.
- Segment remote workers into clusters to tailor productivity strategies.

**Methods**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics and histograms.
- Correlation Analysis: Pearson and Spearman coefficients, visualized in a heatmap.
- Predictive Modeling: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
- Clustering: K-Means clustering to identify worker archetypes.

**Technologies Used**

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Key Findings**

- Top drivers of productivity: Focus Time, Real-Time Feedback, Task Completion Rate.
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression in predictive power.
- Clustering revealed 3 distinct remote worker profiles.

**Ethical Considerations**

- Analysis was conducted on simulated data to preserve privacy.
- Emphasized responsible use of insights to support—not monitor—employees.
